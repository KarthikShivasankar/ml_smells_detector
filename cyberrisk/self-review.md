### Self review

You should always review your own PR first.

For changes, make sure that you:

- [ ] Verify that you are checking inn all files related to the PR. Remember to "add" new files.
- [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy.
- [ ] Verify the changes for adherence to the [style guide](style-guide.md).
- [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.
